  <h3> Calculate Energy Usage per Day</h3>
  <p>For Bubble-View and Historical-View, we used data on energy usage per day. <br><br> We choose to pull data from Egauge server, and then save the data on our data base. <br> <br> Since we want to compare the energy usage between each dorm, we decided to normalize the data for each dorm by how many students are in each dorm.<br><br> Dorm capacity is shown below. </p>

  <h3> Calculate CO2 Generated</h3>
  <p> We calculate CO2 generated by using the kwh data that we pulled from the server, and we use the conversion of <b>1kwh = .6379 pounds</b> of CO2 to generate the CO2 data that we show on the Line-Graph View.</p>
