  <h3> Calculate Energy Usage per Day</h3>
  <p>For Bubble-View and Historical-View, we used data on energy usage per day. <br><br> We choose to pull data from Egauge server, and then save the data on our data base. <br> <br> Since we want to compare the energy usage between each dorm, we decided to normalize the data for each dorm by how many students are in each dorm.<br><br> Dorm capacity is shown below. </p>

  <h3> Calculate CO2 Generated</h3>
  <p> We calculate CO2 generated by using the kwh data that we pulled from the server, and we use the conversion of <b>1kwh = .6379 pounds</b> of CO2 to generate the CO2 data that we show on the Line-Graph View.</p>


  <h3>Calculate Tree Offset</h3>
  <p>Based on the CO2 generated data that we calculated, we use the conversion of <b>1kwh = .00159 tree offsets</b> to calculate how many trees to offset 1kwh of energy usage.</p>

  <h3>Calculate Base Line for Competition</h3>
  <p>We believe that different day of the week will effect how many energy Usage. Thus, we decide to save and pull the data from the latest month and at the same time keep track of which the day of week it is. For example, when we are trying to calculate the improvement on a Monday, then we will pull the energy consumption for all of the Mondays in last month, and compute that average to be our baseline for this Monday for the competition. This will rule out the bias created by the energy consumption differing depending on it being a different day of the week. It will also provide students with a baseline that they can reasonably work on to decrease their energy usage. </p>
